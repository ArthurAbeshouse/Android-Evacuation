<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Android-Evacuation is a 2d action platformer, created by Arthur Abeshouse, similar in vein of the classic mega man games. The game stars Jex, an android who wishes to escape the lab in which they were created. Are you willing to help him escape or let him become scrap metal?</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>There is no instalation required. The game works out of the box in your web browser of choice.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Android Evacuation was designed with an easy to use and intuitive control scheme so that anyone can pick it up and play. If you’re still confused as to how the game works, then please enjoy these step by step instructions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click the Link up top or right here, then you’ll be brought to the title screen.

The title screen is the only part of the game were you can use your mouse. Left click on the play button, and the game will start. There are other options on the main menu, but these instructions only cove how to play the game (NOTE: The game will make a twinkling noise when you’ve clicked on the button)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After clicking “PLAY”, you’ll be droped right into the game.

The goal is to move to the right using either the arrow keys or the ‘W’, ‘A’, ‘S’, ‘D’ keys on your keyboard. To jump, you press the space bar and if you need to take a break, then you can press the ‘P’ key to pause the game. You’ll eventually get the hang of it, we all gotta start somewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we move to the right you’ll see…

    <p>What is that? It’s a funny looking hat. Let’s touch it.</p>

    <p><img src="https://github.com/ArthurAbeshouse/Android-Evacuation/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/6.png" alt="image">
<em>OUCH!</em> That hurt.</p>

    <p>That little hat also took off some of our health. I’ve definitely learned my lesson.

    <p>In order to defend our selfs againts this helmet hermit, we have to shoot him down by pressing the ‘C’ key. Jex will shoot a lemon like pellet from this hand and take out the enemy. Do be careful, you can only hit him when he pops out of his helemet.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that we’ve sucessfully disposed of the hermit, you’ll notice that they sometimes leave behind glowing white-ish, yellow-ish orbs.

 Those are energy pellets, upon touching one you’ll recover some of the lost health from the enemy. The small pellets restore two units of health and the big pelets restore 10 units of health. You’ll need them if you plan to surive.</p>
